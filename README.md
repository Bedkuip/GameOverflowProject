## How to play

After first starting the game, you need to name your Virtual Buddy. Then you need to hatch it by clicking the egg in the middle of the screen. After your pet is hatched, you can start taking care of it. You need to monitor its 3 main status bars: health, food and happiness. Food will slowly deplete overtime automatically, so be sure to keep your buddy fed. Happiness will start depleting if the pet is hungry and health will start depleting if the pet is starving. To feed and heal your buddy, you can buy items at the shop with money. To gain money, keep clicking the flying money gif at the middle left of the screen. Make sure that your pet's health doesn't drop to 0% or it's game over and you'll need to start over again! The game keeps track of the total amount of money that you gained and spent as well as the amount of time that your pet has survived in your care, and displays these stats at the game over screen. Try to get a high score!
