## How to play

After first starting the game, you need to name your Virtual Buddy. Then you need to hatch it by clicking the egg in the middle of the screen. After your pet is hatched, you can start taking care of it. You need to monitor its 3 main status bars: health, food and happiness. Food and happines will slowly deplete overtime automatically, so be sure to keep your buddy fed. Health will start depleting if the pet is starving. Make sure that your pet's health doesn't drop to 0% or it's game over and you'll need to start again. To feed your buddy, you can buy items at the shop with money. To gain money, keep clicking the money icon at the bottom right of the screen.
